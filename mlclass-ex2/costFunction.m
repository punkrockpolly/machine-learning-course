function [J, grad] = costFunction(theta, X, y)
%COSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression
%   J = COSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y) computes the cost of using theta as the
%   parameter for logistic regression and the gradient of the cost
%   w.r.t. to the parameters.

% Initialize some useful values
m = length(y); % number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
grad = zeros(size(theta));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
%               You should set J to the cost.
%               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
%               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
%
% Note: grad should have the same dimensions as theta
%

% hypothesis using the sigmoid function to predict whether h-theta(x) is >1 or < 0
hypothesis = sigmoid(X * theta);

% cost function for all training data using the hypothesis
J = (-1/m) * sum(y .* log(hypothesis) + (1 - y) .* log(1 - hypothesis));

% gradient decent to minimize theta-J(theta)
grad = (1/m) * (X' * (hypothesis - y));
